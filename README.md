# LitepackIreland
My first web development assignment. I developed and deployed a website implementing semantic HTML and CSS. Made use of partials, layouts, flexbox and grid.
Please note - as this was my first foray into web development, the website is optimised for 1920x1080 screens and may not render correctly on mobile.
 
## Introduction
This website acts as a guide to get started with reducing pack weights for through hikes and wild camping. The focus is on Irish trails and conditions.
Visit https://litepackireland.netlify.app/ to view the deployed site.

## Key features
1.	Written using semantic HTML for SEO optimisation and for accessibility for those relying on screen readers.
2.	CSS written from scratch with multiple style sheets.
3.	Optimal web design practices for legibility and ease of site navigation.
4.	Use of the Eleventy framework to implement partials and layouts.

## User guide
1. Download repository zip file.
2. Unzip, and amend code as needed.
